Project : 7- EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
🌟 Exploring the Depths of Data with EDA! 🌟

I’m excited to share that I’ve recently dived into the world of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and it has been an eye-opening journey! 🚀

Here are some key highlights from what I've learned and practiced:

📥 Data Loading & Cleaning: Efficiently loaded datasets and removed unwanted data from columns to streamline the analysis.

🧩 Missing Value Treatment: Applied mean and mode strategies to treat missing values, ensuring data integrity.

🔄 Data Type Conversion: Transformed data types as needed to facilitate accurate analysis.

🔍 Outlier Detection: Identified and handled outliers to improve data quality and reliability.

📊 Univariate & Bivariate Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to understand individual variables and their relationships.

🔗 Variable Identification: Distinguished between independent and dependent variables, laying the groundwork for further modeling.

🛠️ Dummy Variable Creation: Created dummy variables to handle categorical data, making the dataset ready for machine learning models.
